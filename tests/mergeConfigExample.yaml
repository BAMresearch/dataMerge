--- # configuration used to read nexus files into McSAS3. this is assumed to be a 1D file in nexus
# Note that the units are assumed to be 1/(m sr) for I and 1/nm for Q. 
readConfig: # You can adjust the read configuration here: 
  HDFPaths: 
    Q: '/processed/result/q'
    I: '/processed/result/data'
    ISigma: '/processed/result/errors'
    sampleName: '/entry1/sample/name'
    sampleOwner: '/entry1/sample/sampleowner'
    configuration: '/entry1/instrument/configuration'
  HDFDefaults: # in case nothing is found in the paths, you can set defaults for some here:
    sampleName: 'unknown sample name'
    sampleOwner: 'unknown sample owner'
    configuration: 0
    IUnits: '1/(m sr)'
    QUnits: '1/nm'
# Output units can be set, but conversion is not implemented yet. 
eMin: 0.01 # minimum fractional uncertainty estimate (default: 1% of bin intensity)
qeMin: 0.01 # minimum fractional uncertainty estimate (default: 1% of bin intensity)
outputIUnits: '1/(m sr)' # conversion not implemented yet
outputQUnits: '1/nm' # conversion not implemented yet
# now we're defining the individual input range settings. Not every range needs to be specified, but  
ranges:
  - rangeId: -1 # sorted by q range, 0 is the dataset with the smallest availalbe qmin. can also be left -1 to determine range by config
    qMinPreset: null # null takes the minimum available
    qMaxPreset: null # ibid
    autoscaleToConfig: null # no autoscaling
    findByConfig: 127 # for example, the long config 
  - rangeId: 2 # not every range needs presets
    qMinPreset: 0.01 # not every setting needs specifying
    autoscaleToConfig: 127
# we define the output binning here. These are range segments, ending where the next range begins. 
outputRanges: # list of range or ranges defining the output binning, from smallest q to largest q. 
  - outputRangeId: 0 # start from zero, add as many as you need. 
    qCrossover: 0. #   starting Q for this output range
    nbins: 200
    QScaling: 'log' # 'log' or 'linear'
  - outputRangeId: 1 # second range for WAXS
    qCrossover: 1. # start this range at Q=1 inverse nm
    nbins: 300 # bit higher resolution
    QScaling: 'linear' # 'log' or 'linear'
# add more (higher) ranges as needed
